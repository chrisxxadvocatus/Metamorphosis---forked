# Metamorphosis
Monitor and visualize your Kafka cluster with Metamorphosis:
Metamorphosis is a monitoring and visualization tool for your Kafka cluster that allows developers to quickly test whether new services are functioning correctly. It provides a set of dashboards to inspect each component in the cluster and debug problems when they occur. The tool can be deployed on-premise, so you donâ€™t have to rely on expensive cloud solutions.
